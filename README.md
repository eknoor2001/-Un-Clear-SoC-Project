# (Un)Clear SoC Project 2021

***Repository for (Un)Clear SoC Project, done in the Summer of 2021.***



### THEME: 
> This project tackled the problem of Image Super Resolution using Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversial Neural Networks [ESRGAN].  Image super-resolution (SR) techniques reconstruct a higher-resolution image or sequence from the observed lower-resolution images. Often a low-resolution image is taken as an input and the same image is upscaled to a higher resolution, which is the output. The details in the high-resolution output are filled in where the details are essentially unknown.




##Course of the Project, Files' Description and What I Learned:

### Week 0: Basic Python Tutorial and Introduction to GitHub [24 Mar '21 - 30 Mar '21] 
  - Complete Python tutorial, that helped me revise concepts I learned earlier in Python and got to know about a few new functions, libraries, etc. [Link to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
  - Introduction to the concept of Object Oriented Programming, which essentially allows programmers to think of software development as if they are working with real-life entities. (Same link as above)
  - Git Tutorial, which helped me get started with GitHub, including creation of repositories, commiting changes, etc. [Link to tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
  
### Week 1: Image Processing in OpenCV and Basic Machine Learning [31 Mar '21 - 6 Apr '21] 
  - OpenCV is an Open Computer Vision Library which is extremely versatile and powerful to handle image files and perform various transformations to them. The Tutorial taught me about dozens of image processing functions, which helped me do:-
  - **ASSIGNMENT 1:** [Steps and content detailed in Assignment 1 folder](https://github.com/eknoor2001/-Un-Clear-SoC-Project/tree/main/Assignment%20Week%201) 
  - PART 1 Google Machine Learning Course began with a basic introduction to concepts of machine learning, which was continued in Week 2 [Link to Google ML Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro)

### Week 2: Basic Machine Learning (CONTD.) and TensorFlow [11 Apr '21 - 17 Apr '21] 
  - The Google Machine Learning Course started in Week 1 was continued in Week 2, wrapping up relevant concepts like Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc. that helped develop the basic understanding for this project: [Link to Google ML Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro)
  - Learnt about Tensor Flow which is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. [Link to Udacity course for TensorFlow](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187)
  - **ASSIGNMENT 2:** Digit Classifier using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) from the concepts learnt above: [detailed in Assignment 2 folder](https://github.com/eknoor2001/-Un-Clear-SoC-Project/tree/main/Assignment%20Week%202)

## MIDSEMESTER EXAMINATIONS BREAK ##

### Week 3 and 4: ResNet, GAN and Conditional GAN [8 May '21 - 21 May '21] 
  - Learning about a new convolutional model: ResNet [Residual Neural Network] through a detailed tutorial [Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-resnet-model-from-scratch-971be7193718) 
  - Introduction to GAN, which are essentially deep generative models composed of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, opposed to each other.
 [Generative Adversial Network](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxQ7SoCLQAMGgQAIAcyRevM8VvygTpCu) and Conditional GAN [CGAN](https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-adversarial-networks-gans-89ef35a60b69) through detailed tutorials.
  - **ASSIGNMENT 3:** Implementation of CGAN using the concepts learnt in the above tutorial [in Assignment 3 folder](https://github.com/eknoor2001/-Un-Clear-SoC-Project/tree/main/Assignment%20CGAN%20Week%203)

### Week 5, 6 and 7: SRGAN and ESRGAN Models [22 May '21 - 11 Jun '21] 
  - Studied one of the latest papers in this field, about Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) and  Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN), which are much more advanced GANs by reading the original papers written: [SRGAN Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), [ESRGAN Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219). 
  - **Final Implementation/ASSIGNMENT 4:** Implemented the ESRGAN model using the [tutorial provided](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/esrgan-enhanced-super-resolution-generative-adversarial-network-using-keras-a34134b72b77): Explained in [Assignment 4 folder](https://github.com/eknoor2001/-Un-Clear-SoC-Project/tree/main/Assignment%204%20ESRGAN%20Implementation)

### Week 6: Final Implementation, Documentation [12 Jul '21 - 18 Jul '21] 
  - Final ESRGAN model implementation was refined
  - Proper documentation of the project report, including this ReadMe file
