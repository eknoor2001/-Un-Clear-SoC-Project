# (Un)Clear SoC Project 2021

#### Repository for (Un)Clear SoC Project, done in the Summer of 2021. 



### THEME: This project tackled the problem of Image Super Resolution using Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversial Neural Networks [ESRGAN]  Image super-resolution (SR) techniques reconstruct a higher-resolution image or sequence from the observed lower-resolution images. Often a low-resolution image is taken as an input and the same image is upscaled to a higher resolution, which is the output. The details in the high-resolution output are filled in where the details are essentially unknown.




Course of the Project and What I Learned:-

# Week 0:
  - Complete Python tutorial, that helped me revise concepts I learned earlier in Python and got to know about new functions, libraries, etc.
  - GIT Tutorial, which helped me get started with GitHub!
  
# Week 1:
  - OpenCV Tutorial taught me about dozens of image processing functions, which helped me do the Assignment 1 [detailed in Assignment 1 folder] 
  - PART 1 Google Machine Learning Course began with a basic introduction to concepts of machine learning, which will be continued in Week 2

# Week 2:
  - Completed the Google Machine Learning Course
  - Learnt about Tensor Flow from the Udacity Course
  - Digit Recogniser using CNN from the concepts learnt above [detailed in Assignment 2 folder]

# Week 3:
  - Learning about a new convolutional model: ResNet
  - Introduction to GAN [Generative Adversial Network] and Conditional GAN (CGAN)
  - Implementation of CGAN [in Assignment 3 folder]

# Week 4:
  - Lerant about the latest SRGAN and ESRGAN reading the original papers about them
  - Implemented the ESRGAN model [in Assignment 4 folder]
